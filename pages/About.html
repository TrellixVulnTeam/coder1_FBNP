            195 Studios is the most famous recording studio in the world, 
            renowned for its creativity and technological excellence. 
            It is a global icon that for the last 90 years has been 
            the musical home to The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Shirley Bassey,  
            Cilla Black, Yehudi Menuhin, Jaqueline du Pre, Ella Fitzgerald, 
            Fela Kuti, Kate Bush, Oasis and Radiohead to Sam Smith,
            Florence + The Machine, 
            Ed Sheeran, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 
            Frank Ocean, Amy Winehouse, Brockhampton and Adele.
            The story of 195 Studios is the story of recorded music. In 1929, when recordings were still 
            being made acoustically through 
            a large wooden horn and a wax disc, the Gramophone Company were looking for a location to dedicate to this new industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            They found a nine-bedroom house with a large garden for sale in St John’s Wood, North West London, 
            and bought it for £16,500 before spending two years building the world’s first purpose-built recording studio.
            By the time the studios opened in 1931, the Gramophone Company had merged with Columbia to become Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI).</p>
<p> 
           195 studios was officially opened with a seminal performance of Sir Edward Elgar’s Land of Hope and Glory on 12 November 1931. 
           It was a suitably grand opening for a studio that would go on to host legends of the classical and orchestral world including 
           Sir Thomas Beecham, Geoff Love and Daniel Barenboim to name a few, as well as Paul Robeson and Fats Waller.
           For the last 40 years, 195 studios has become one of the world’s premier destinations for film scoring, with projects including Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
           the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, many of the Star Wars and Harry Potter series, Black Panther,
          1917, Avengers and Oscar-winners such as Gravity and The Shape of Water.
